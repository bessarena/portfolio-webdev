# Porfolio Web - Diogo Bessa

This is my personal web developer portfolio. It may look simple now, but it represents the beginning of my journey.

> My goal is to build a solid foundation and keep evolving it over time — adding new skills, improving the design, and modernizing it as I grow as a developer.
